        Since childhood, Science and Technology was always what I looked up to.
        Due to my interest in programming, I immediately started dwelling deep
        into the fields of Computer Science. I am currently exploring the world
        of web development, machine learning and data science. I have used C++,
        Python, Java and Javascript with tools such as numpy, matplotlib,
        pandas, scikit learn, ReactJS and Express throughout my academic
        projects. I have won Data Hack, North India's biggest Data Science
        hackathon (in terms of prize money) and my team was the first runner up
        in Infineon India Campus Hackathon in AI/ML track, held in Bengaluru,
        India. Occasionally, I write for the medium publication 'towards data
        science' as well. Currently I'm working at Flipkart as a Software
        Developer. As the world is becoming more technology-driven, I realise
        that the possibilities of development and data in Computer Science are
        limitless in each and every aspect of Computer Science and still not yet
        explored completely. I take great pleasure to be part of this field
        which is so innovative and promising. I love fictions and Sci-fi films.
        I play guitar in my leisure time.
