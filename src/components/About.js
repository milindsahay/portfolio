        Since childhood, Science and Technology was always what I looked up to.
        Due to my interest in programming, I immediately started dwelling deep
        into the fields of Computer Science. I am currently exploring the world
        of machine learning, data science and web development. I have also used
        C++, Python and Javascript with tools such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas,
        scikit learn, ReactJS and Express throughout my academic projects. I
        have won many Hackathons and competitions including Code Wars which
        rigorously checked participantâ€™s logic, reasoning and ability to code
        within a stipulated time.I have also won Data Hack, North India's
        biggest Data Science hackathon (in terms of prize money) and my team was
        the first runner up in Infineon India Campus Hackathon in AI/ML track,
        held in Bengaluru, India. Currently I'm working at Flipkart as a
        Software Developer. As the world is becoming more technology-driven, I
        realise that the possibilities of development and data in Computer
        Science are limitless in each and every aspect of Computer Science and
        still not yet explored completely. I take great pleasure to be part of
        this field which is so innovative and promising. I love fictions and
        Sci-fi films. I play guitar in my leisure time.
